[LiverAtlas_PA](LiverAtlas_PA)    | Contains raw proteomics datasets for atlas samples, primary cell culture expriemnt and patient samples, and the Jupyter notebook for data analysis.
[LiverAtlas_DashApp](LiverAtlas_DashApp)    | Contains source code for the web-based dashboard application. 

## Disclaimer
Source data for the web-based dashboard application is not available due to continuous development of the webpage and the need to maintain potential patient-sensitive data.
